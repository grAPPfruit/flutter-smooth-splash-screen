# smooth_splash
  
Let's be honest, who has a lot of time these days? Waiting for something to happen is not fun. So we always want everything instantly or as we developers put it: synchronous.  
  
But what do you do if you have someone that you need to wait for before you can start doing something? A so called asynchronous dependency.  
  
I can't remember the last time I wrote an app that didn't have some form of asynchronous dependency when it launched. This is what the splash screen is used for.

And this is why I've created this Repository.

Also, there is a [Medium](https://medium.com/@roland.wimmer/flutter-splash-screen-a-simple-way-to-handle-async-dependencies-7a9f559eb280) article that goes along side with it.
You should check it out.
